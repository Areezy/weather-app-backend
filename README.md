# Weather App Backend

This server built in Express serves as a proxy for my [weather app](https://weather-app-areezy.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used
- Node JS
- Express
- Axios 
- CORS

## Getting Started
`npm install`
`npm start`

An API key from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) and the link to your frontend are needed to be set as environmental variables.
